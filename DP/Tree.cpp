/*
 * Description:	Give a tree with n vertices,each edge has a length(positive integer less than 1001). 
 *				Define dist(u,v)=The min distance between node u and v. 
 *				Give an integer k,for every pair (u,v) of vertices is called valid if and only if dist(u,v) not exceed k. 
 *				Write a program that will count how many pairs which are valid for a given tree. 
 *
 * Input:	The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k. (n<=10000) The following n-1 lines each *
 *			contains three integers u,v,l, which means there is an edge between node u and v of length l. The last test case is followed by two zeros. 
 *
 * Output:	For each test case output the answer on a single line.
